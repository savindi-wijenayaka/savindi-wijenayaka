I'm a software engineer turned researcher fueled by the potential of machine learning to revolutionize healthcare. My passion lies in developing AI solutions for medical image diagnosis and drug discovery. There's nothing more rewarding than knowing my work could contribute to a product that truly makes a difference in someone's life.😄 Beyond the code, I break down complex programming and AI concepts into clear and simple language as a technical writer.✍🏾 Outside the world of algorithms, you'll find me capturing stunning landscapes through photography📷 or exploring new corners of the globe. Looking to connect with fellow engineers, researchers, and anyone passionate about using AI to push the boundaries of healthcare! 💌
