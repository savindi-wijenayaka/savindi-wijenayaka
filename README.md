I'm driven by the excitement of turning ideas into tools that are useful, meaningful, and make a real difference in the world. My work spans deep learning, production-grade cloud-native development, and hands-on research, with a focus on computer vision and computational analysis. There's nothing more rewarding than knowing my work could contribute to a product that truly makes a difference in someone's life.😄 Beyond the code, I break down complex programming and AI concepts into clear and simple language as a technical writer.✍🏾 Outside the world of algorithms, you'll find me capturing stunning landscapes through photography📷 or exploring new corners of the globe✈️. Looking to connect with fellow engineers, researchers, and anyone passionate about using AI to push the boundaries of knowledge! 💌
